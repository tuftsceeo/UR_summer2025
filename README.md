# UR_summer2025
Summer 2025 work by Leia Hannes and Hannah Loly. 

**UR_library_2025** is a modified version of myur3e.py (https://github.com/tuftsceeo/Universal-Robots-ROS2-CEEO/blob/main/myur/myur3e.py) and includes base classes used in both the clay and violin projects. 

**clay_commands** has two classes, ClaySculpt and ClayTrajectory, that inherit from the MyUR3e and Trajectory classes found in UR_library_2025. 

**lib_testing** includes tests for UR_library commands and clay_commands. 

**play_doh** is our Jupyter notebook code for the Hackathon. This uses the libraries prior to class implementation and is slightly out of date as a result.
